# Structure

*The structure tries to follow git/dev best practices*

* /lib
** Contains external libraries and our own header file (.h)

* /src
** Contains our source code only (.c)

* /build
** Contains the program's stable/debug binaries and compiled files

* /tests
** Contains ALL the tests, keep them separate HERE

* /scripts
** Automatization scripts, for custom operations not including Makefile which is at the root level

* /res
** Contains all the static ressources, as images
